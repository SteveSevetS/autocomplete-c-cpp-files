# Autocomplete C/C++ files

This extension will write the implementation of your C/C++ code without make you copy and paste like an idiot

## Features

the extension will generate the implementation file, if you run the command "write implementation file", or will generate the implementation for the functions at the end of the file, if you run the command "Parse main file"

### Write implementation file:
!(images/feature_write_impl_file.mp4)

> The command will read the header file and will print in a file that will prompt side by side the header file in the editor.

### Parse main file:
\!\[feature Y\]\(images/feature-y.png\)
> The command will read the focused file in the editor and will append the methods signatures at the end of the file.
